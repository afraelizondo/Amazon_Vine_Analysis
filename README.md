# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

Big Market is a startup that helps businesses to optimice their marketing. 

In this project weâ€™ll be working with big data, in other words, data that exceeds the capacity of operational databases. 

Big data has four main characteristics, as listed below:
1. Volume; data size.
2. Velocity; how quickly data comes in. 
3. Variety; different forms of data. 
4. Veracity; concerns the uncertainty of data. 

The analysis was performed with data of the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. 

This specifically dataset is about pet produts. According to Statista (2018), the online pet market has nearly quadrupled since 2013, showing as top categories:
- Vitamins
- Pet supplies
- Pet food

With 70% of American households owning at least one pet, The U.S. pet industry was worth $76.8 billion by November 2022. 

Some of the major advantages of this industry growing as an e-commerce, are the convenience and comfort, product information and choice and having the opportunity to compare prices before choosing the one that has more value in general.

- In total, there were 170 Vine reviews, and 37,840 non-Vine reviews. 
- Talking about the 5 stars rating, there were 65 for Vine reviews and 20,612 for non-Vine reviews. 
- In conclussion, the percentage of these 5 stars review is divided like this:

Vine reviews  | Non-Vine reviews
------------- | -------------
38.23%        | 54.47%


## Summary 

According to the results, in this category of products, there was not a positivity bias if there is a comparation between the paid reviews (38%) and unpaid reviews (54%) this could reflect that the reviewers in the Vine program make a more detailed analysis to rate and describe the products, due to the fact that they get a compensation for their time and honesty, this is good for the companies because based on these reviews, they could improve their products characteristics and service. 

### Additional analysis 

Another analysis that can be performed in order to support the previous statement, would be to get the percentage for every category on the "star-rating" column, having a total of 5 total percentages for paid reviews, and 5 for unpaid reviews, so we can make a deeper analysis using these numbers.
